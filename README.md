# MNIST Classifier

My "Hello world" project of Neural Networks

## Prerequisites

Before trying the programs, make sure `numpy`, `opencv-python` are properly
installed.

## Currently Implemented

* mnist\_interpreter: This is a script that helps you view the labeled images
from either of the training or testing data sets. It is well-documented, so
developers are easy to understand the format of IDX file and can implement new
interpreters by themselves.
